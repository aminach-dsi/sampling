# Assignment: Questionnaire Design (Part B)

## Requirements
1. Comment on the quality of your sample. Do you expect it to be representative of your target population? Why or why not?

    ```
    The sample quality is expected to be reasonably representative of the target population due to the use of stratified random sampling, which ensures coverage across various departments and roles within entry- and lower-level positions. This approach helps capture department-specific issues while identifying overarching factors affecting turnover. However, the representativeness may still be influenced by response rates and the possibility of nonresponse bias, as dissatisfied employees may respond more frequently and Employees who are satisfied or indifferent might be less inclined to complete the survey, leading to an underrepresentation of their perspectives. As a result, if certain departments or teams are underrepresented, the sample may not fully reflect the experiences of all employees.

    ```

2. Given the class content (error, survey quality, ethics) covered since Part A of the assignment, do you wish to make any changes to your original survey? If so, make a copy of your original survey and make any desired changes. Describe the changes and your reasoning. Provide a link here for submission.

    ```
    **Revised Survey Questions:**

	- I would add a consent Statement to ensure compliance with ethical guidelines and fosters trust among respondents:
    "Participation in this survey is voluntary, and your responses will remain confidential. By continuing, you consent to participate."
	- What age range do you fall into? (Options: 18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45+), Add Demographic question as demographic diversity provides deeper insights into potential patterns and disparities.
	- How long have you been working at the company? (Options: <1 year, 1-2 years, >2 years) : increase the survey quality using Closed-ended question.
	- What is your current position or role in the company? avoid ambiguity by adding "in the company"
	- If you have considered leaving, what were the main reasons? Multiple-choice with "Other" as an open-ended option.
	- On a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = Very poor, 5 = Excellent), how would you rate the support you receive from your manager or supervisor? Added a numeric scale to standardize responses, making the data easier to analyze quantitatively.
	- To what extent does the company support your work-life balance? (Scale: Not at all, Somewhat, Completely)? Adjusted wording to make questions more neutral and less leading.
	- Can you describe any specific challenges you face in achieving work-life balance? Add a follow up question to capture qualitative feedback.
	- Do you feel there are sufficient opportunities for career growth within the company? (Yes/No, with space for comments)
	- How satisfied are you with your compensation and benefits package? (Scale: Very dissatisfied to Very satisfied), combined two questions to reduce redundancy and keep the survey concise.
	- On a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = Very poor, 5 = Excellent), how would you rate your relationship with your colleagues and teammates? add a scale for more clarity.

    ```

3. Could the purpose of your survey have been fulfilled through an observational study? If yes, how? If no, why not?

    ```
    No, I donâ€™t think the purpose of the survey could be fulfilled through an observational study.
    An observational study could analyze existing data, such as exit interviews, employee performance reviews, turnover trends by department, and HR metrics like absenteeism and engagement scores. This approach might reveal patterns and correlations (e.g., high turnover in specific departments or roles) that suggest underlying causes of dissatisfaction.
    However, an observational study would lack the direct input from employees still working at the company, particularly about their experiences, unmet needs, or suggestions for improvement. Observational data is also limited to what has already occurred and cannot capture potential solutions or sentiments about changes employees want, which are central to the survey's purpose.

## Why am I doing this assignment?

This assignment supports learning outcomes 1, 2, 3, and 4:
	1.	Develop ability to implement simple probability samples.
	2.	Understand more complicated sampling procedures and the tradeoffs involved.
	3.	Identify and understand sources of error or inaccuracies in data as a result of sampling strategies.
	4.	Develop intuition around survey quality.

## Rubric

-	All required components are present and complete **Complete / Incomplete**
-	Assessment of representativeness is justified based on class content **Complete / Incomplete**
-	Changes to original survey are justified based on class content and best practices for sampling **Complete / Incomplete**
